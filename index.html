            <p> Hello! This landing page was primarily while still at university. The work that I have been doing at Facebook
                since graduation (and much of anything since 2017) is not reflected here, but is summarized on my resume and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakepodell/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate from Cornell Engineering. At school
                I was involved in Cornell's Unmanned Air Systems team, and received a bachelor's in Computer Science. If I am not at my desk,
                you can find me at the gym or listening to classic rock.

                        On the CUAir Electrical Team, I aid the development of an autonomous plane to represent my school in the Unmanned Air
                        Systems competition. My team's responsibilities include on-system computing, radio communications, and power distribution.
                        My main responsibilities have been developing our air \drop system, implementing a simulated remote information center, and choosing our on-board computer.

                        While I started with simple contributions and bug fixes, I was eventually given leading roles in my projects.

                        This simple and addictive game was my first published android app. After spending the majority of high school
                        focused on Java, I was eager to practice some of the languages applications. Developing the app gave me a better
                        understanding of my primary language, which was helpful when learning Java frameworks such as JavaFX.
                        Working on the game also made me comfortable programming for mobile platforms.

                        Since the end of my senior year I have worked from home/school as graphic designer. I mainly design and
                        produce logos and artwork for professional, athletic, and college organizations. Having the opportunity
                        to regularly flex a creative muscle helps me keep my engineering projects fresh and unique.
